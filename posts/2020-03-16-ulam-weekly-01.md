We are so glad to release, **"Ulam Weekly,"** a new series of weekly post that features the week's highlight, what we cooked and eat plus some random stuff that we found useful or interesting.

## SITAW ADOBO

We got some seasonal string beans and made a vegetable adobo, absolutely not vegetarian as it's loaded of pork belly strips.

## Tortilla Patata a la Abuela
Our adorable Granny neighbor came knocking just before dinner to share her amazing *tortilla patata* just cooked, literally just off the stove and still in the skillet pan.

And gave us a generous slice and took back the rest for their dinner. Typically paired with red wine (*vino tinto*) makes a simple yet delicious dinner!
