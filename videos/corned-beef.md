In today's episode, we want to share how to make Filipino style CORNED BEEF that is juicy and meaty. Pinoystyle canned corned beef is way more better in flavor and texture the the 'imported' versions.

It's simple and easy to make with just a few ingredients. Try it and you'll have unlimited Carne Norte!

## Ingredients
- 1 kg. Beef Shank
- 1 tsp. Nutmeg
- 1 tsp. Onion Powder
- 1 tsp. Garlic Powder
- 1 tbsp. Salt
- 2.5 cups Water

Now that we have our corned beef made, let's cook **Ginisang Corned Beef.**
Saut√© our homemade corned beef with fresh garlic, patis, black peper and onion rings to garnish. Serve on rice and sunny-side up eggs.

Try it and you'll surprise yourself and the family that you can actually make Carne Norte from scratch and cook something even better than the canned version that's a classic favorite!

***Salamat po!***
