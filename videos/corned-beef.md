In today's episode, we want to share how to make Filipino style CORNED BEEF that is both juicy and meaty. Pinoy-style canned corned beef is packed with more flavors and texture than the 'imported' versions.

Do not be intimidated with the big flavors you get when you open a can of your favorite corned beef. The truth is, it's simple and easy to make with just a few ingredients. Try it and you'll have unlimited Carne Norte!

## Ingredients
- 1 kg. Beef Shank
- 1 tsp. Nutmeg
- 1 tsp. Onion Powder
- 1 tsp. Garlic Powder
- 1 tbsp. Salt
- 2.5 cups Water

Now that we have our corned beef made, let's cook **Ginisang Corned Beef.**
Sauté our homemade corned beef with fresh garlic, patis, black peper and onion rings to garnish. Serve on rice and sunny-side up eggs.
